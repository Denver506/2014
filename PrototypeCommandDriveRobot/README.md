This is a very basic program for a robot with two motors, one for the left wheels and one for the right wheels.
The robot is controlled using an arcade-style single joystick: forward, reverse, turn left, turn right.
The joystick position also controls the variable-speed motors, though buttons on the joystick can increase
or decrease the maximum speed.
